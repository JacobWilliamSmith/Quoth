Jack and Jill
Went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Jill came tumbling after.

Up Jack got
And home did trot,
As fast as he could caper;
Went to bed
To mend his head
With vinegar and brown paper.

Jill came in
And she did grin
To see his paper plaster;
Mother, vexâ€™d,
Did whip her next
For causing Jack's disaster.
